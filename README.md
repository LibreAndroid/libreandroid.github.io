# Libre Android

Android is one of most known open-source projects,
yets it is not.

Known as AOSP, it is slowly becoming closed source and dominated by Google.  
When Android company was purchased by Google, it was making what many others were doing: 
GUI over Linux for resource constrained devices.

and promises to telecom companies and many device manufacturers
multiplied by Google finances and influence, Android OS became standard and then dominant OS.
