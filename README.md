# Libre Android

Android is one of most known open-source projects,
yets it is not.

Known as AOSP, it is slowly becoming closed source and dominated by Google.  
When Android company was purchased by Google, it was making what many others were doing: 
GUI over Linux for resource constrained devices.  
With insights of mobile phone becoming smart general computing device,  
and promises to telecom companies and many device manufacturers
multiplied by Google finances and influence, Android OS became standard and then dominant OS.

Direction of Android OS development is open/transparent. 
Features appear in big role, then announce mostly to attract beta testers.


Similar to Microsoft, Google now strives to influence hardware standards.

With Android 10 patches can be pushed into Android OS bypassing device vendors, 
yet nothing is about said about sources for those patched, and how it can be verfied.
